Attacking and Defending needs to be considered:

Does a Player call an attack on an enemy.  

And when an enemy is near on their turn does the player technically called defend on the enemy>?

What is the difference between attack and defend?  

Attack goes first, defend second?  Do they change the weighting of the attack and defend stats?

How are outcomes defined, some kind of dice role generator?  What are the rules?

How many attacks do they get, is an attack followed by a defence, or does an attack combine with a defence?
