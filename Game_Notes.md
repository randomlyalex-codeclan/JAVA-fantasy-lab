Attacking and Defending needs to be considered:

Does a Player call an attack on an enemy.  

And when an enemy is near on their turn does the player technically called defend on the enemy>?

What is the difference between attack and defend?  

Attack goes first, defend second?  Do they change the weighting of the attack and defend stats?

How are outcomes defined, some kind of dice role generator?  What are the rules?

How many attacks do they get, is an attack followed by a defence, or does an attack combine with a defence?



Ok so I think I need a dice generator / roller (which takes the amount of sides and rolls it giving a result)

Each turn each player rolls a dice to decide who goes first in the sequence?

The turn sequence is generated with another class?

Choices follows this sequence, if someone dies they are removed from this sequence, at the end of the turn the sequence should be empty.

// below needs more thought.

Maybe each turn each player can do one of each Interface only in the order they wish?


Combat will be opposing players (only one player one enemy can fight each other) rolls x amount of dice, and something like highest number wins, or pick highest 3 dice?

Do the attack and defence rating act as modifiers to the roll or to the damage?

Whoever loses, something happens with their health related to the encounter, how is that calculated?
